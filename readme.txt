# Katia's Bike Share Data Project

## About This Project

Hello! Welcome to my Bike Share Python Project. This project was created to meet completion requirements for my 
Udacity [Programming for Data Science with Python][1] course. Through this course, I learned basics of Python programming
and how to create a program that could conduct some statistical analysis of US Bike Share data. This program prompts the 
user with some questions about the following:
* which city they want to filter data for
* which month they want to filter data for
* which day they want to filter data for 

The program also checks for whether the user wants to continue through the various statistical analysis checkpoints.

I hope you enjoy the project and get to learn some fun facts about US Bike Share data!
